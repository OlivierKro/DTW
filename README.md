# Dynamic Time Warping
 Program was created for the purposes of a project at studies. In the future program will comparison my implementation with implementation by using packages.

## Short description
 Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a time series alignment algorithm. It aims at aligning two sequences of feature vectors by warping the time axis iteratively until an optimal match (according to a suitable metrics) between the two sequences is found.

## Technology
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python 3.9.7
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## How to run program
Just open program code in Jupyter Notebook
